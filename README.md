This project was a collaboration between Rasha Baig and Tanya Radu, where each of us took responsibility over certain components on the back end and certain components on the front end. 

CareTaker is an app designed to help users manage, monitor, and track their health. Functionality includes being able to add doctors, add medications, add doctors appointments, log metrics including blood sugar, blood pressure, and weight, and view data visualizations.
